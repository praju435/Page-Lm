[{"id":1,"question":"A phone plan costs $30/month plus $0.05/minute. If a bill was $42.50, how many minutes were used?","options":["1) 150 minutes","2) 200 minutes","3) 250 minutes","4) 300 minutes"],"correct":3,"hint":"Formulate an equation where the total bill is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost.","explanation":"Let m be the number of minutes. The total cost is 30 + 0.05m. So, 30 + 0.05m = 42.50. Subtract 30 from both sides: 0.05m = 12.50. Divide by 0.05: m = 12.50 / 0.05 = 250 minutes."},{"id":2,"question":"What is the product of the roots of the equation 3x^2 - 7x + 2 = 0?","options":["1) -7/3","2) 2/3","3) 7/3","4) -2/3"],"correct":2,"hint":"Remember Vieta's formulas for the product of roots in a quadratic equation.","explanation":"For a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the product of the roots is c/a. In this case, a=3, b=-7, and c=2. Thus, the product of the roots is 2/3."},{"id":3,"question":"If f(x) = 2x - 3 and g(x) = x^2 + 1, what is the value of f(g(2))?","options":["A) 2","B) 5","C) 7","D) 11"],"correct":3,"hint":"Evaluate the inner function g(2) first, then substitute the result into the outer function f(x).","explanation":"First, calculate g(2): g(2) = (2)^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5. Next, substitute this value into f(x): f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7."},{"id":4,"question":"Apples are $1.50, oranges $2.00. 8 fruits cost $13.00. How many apples were bought?","options":["A) 2","B) 4","C) 6","D) 8"],"correct":3,"hint":"Define variables for the number of apples and oranges, then create a system of two equations.","explanation":"Let 'a' be apples and 'o' be oranges. Equations: a + o = 8 and 1.5a + 2o = 13. Substitute o = 8 - a into the second equation: 1.5a + 2(8 - a) = 13. Simplify: 1.5a + 16 - 2a = 13. This yields -0.5a = -"},{"id":5,"question":"What is the equation of a line parallel to y = 3x - 5 and passing through (2, 4)?","options":["1) y = 3x + 1","2) y = 3x - 2","3) y = -1/3x + 4","4) y = 3x - 5"],"correct":2,"hint":"Parallel lines share the same slope. Use the point-slope form with the given point.","explanation":"A line parallel to y = 3x - 5 has a slope of 3. Using the point-slope form y - y1 = m(x - x1) with (2, 4): y - 4 = 3(x - 2). This simplifies to y - 4 = 3x - 6, so y = 3x - 2."}]
