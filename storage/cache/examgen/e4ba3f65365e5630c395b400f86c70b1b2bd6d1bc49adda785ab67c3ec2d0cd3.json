[{"id":1,"question":"A sum is distributed among P, Q, R. P gets 20%, Q gets 30%, R gets the rest. If R receives $1200 more than P, what is Q's share?","options":["1) $800","2) $1200","3) $2000","4) $4000"],"correct":2,"hint":"First, determine R's percentage share, then set up an equation based on the difference.","explanation":"P=0.2S, Q=0.3S, R=0.5S. R receives $1200 more than P: 0.5S - 0.2S = 0.3S = $1200. Thus, S = $4000. Q's share = 0.3S = 0.3 * $4000 = $1200."},{"id":2,"question":"Machine A completes a task in 10 hours. Machine B completes the same task in 15 hours. If Machine A works alone for 5 hours and then B joins it, how many more h","options":["A) 2 hours","B) 3 hours","C) 3.5 hours","D) 4 hours"],"correct":2,"hint":"Calculate the work done by A, then the remaining work, and finally the combined rate.","explanation":"Rate A=1/10, Rate B=1/15. A works 5 hours, completing 5*(1/10) = 1/2 task. Remaining task = 1/2. Combined rate = 1/10 + 1/15 = 5/30 = 1/6. Time = (1/2) / (1/6) = 3 hours."},{"id":3,"question":"A circular pizza with a radius of 10 inches is cut into 8 equal slices. What is the approximate area of one slice, in square inches? (Use π ≈ 3.14)","options":["A) 19.6","B) 31.4","C) 39.25","D) 78.5"],"correct":3,"hint":"First, calculate the total area of the pizza, then divide by the number of slices.","explanation":"Area of circle = πr^2 = π * (10)^2 = 100π. For 8 equal slices, area of one slice = (1/8) * 100π = 12.5π. Using π ≈ 3.14, Area = 12.5 * 3.14 = 39.25 square inches."},{"id":4,"question":"Train P leaves Station A at 9:00 AM traveling east at 60 mph. Train Q leaves Station A at 10:00 AM traveling east at 75 mph. At what time will Train Q overtake ","options":["A) 12:00 PM","B) 1:00 PM","C) 1:30 PM","D) 2:00 PM"],"correct":4,"hint":"Calculate the distance Train P travels before Train Q starts, then use relative speed.","explanation":"At 10:00 AM, P is 60 miles ahead (60 mph * 1 hr). Q starts. Relative speed = 75 - 60 = 15 mph. Time to overtake = 60 miles / 15 mph = 4 hours. Overtake time = 10:00 AM + 4 hours = 2:00 PM."},{"id":5,"question":"A class of 30 students has an average score of 75. If the average score of the 10 boys in the class is 70, what is the average score of the girls in the class?","options":["1) 77.5","2) 78","3) 78.5","4) 80"],"correct":1,"hint":"Calculate the total sum of scores for the entire class and for the boys first.","explanation":"Total class sum = 30 * 75 = 2250. Boys' total sum = 10 * 70 = 700. Girls count = 30 - 10 = 20. Girls' total sum = 2250 - 700 = 1550. Girls' average = 1550 / 20 = 77.5."}]
