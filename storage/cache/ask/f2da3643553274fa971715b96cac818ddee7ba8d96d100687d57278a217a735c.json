{"topic":"Summary of Machine Learning: Definition and Workflow","answer":"Imagine Machine Learning (ML) as teaching a computer to be a 'smart apprentice.' Instead of giving it every single rule, you feed it lots of data, and it learns patterns to make predictions or decisions on its own. It iteratively improves by practicing, comparing its guesses to correct answers, and adjusting itself, much like how we learn from experience. Once trained, it can then apply these learned insights to new, real-world challenges.","flashcards":[{"q":"Why is Machine Learning described as learning from 'patterns in data' rather than being 'explicitly programmed with every rule'?","a":"Explicitly programming every possible rule for complex tasks (like recognizing a cat in a photo) would be practically impossible. ML allows the computer to discover these intricate rules and relationships itself by analyzing vast datasets and refining its understanding through feedback, making it adaptable and efficient.","tags":["anti_rote","deep","transfer","why","concept"]}]}
