{"examId":"gmat","name":"GMAT Focus Simulation","sections":[{"id":"quant","title":"Quantitative Reasoning","durationSec":2100,"items":[{"id":1,"question":"A sum is distributed among P, Q, R. P gets 20%, Q gets 30%, R gets the rest. If R receives $1200 more than P, what is Q's share?","options":["1) $800","2) $1200","3) $2000","4) $4000"],"correct":2,"hint":"First, determine R's percentage share, then set up an equation based on the difference.","explanation":"P=0.2S, Q=0.3S, R=0.5S. R receives $1200 more than P: 0.5S - 0.2S = 0.3S = $1200. Thus, S = $4000. Q's share = 0.3S = 0.3 * $4000 = $1200."},{"id":2,"question":"Machine A completes a task in 10 hours. Machine B completes the same task in 15 hours. If Machine A works alone for 5 hours and then B joins it, how many more h","options":["A) 2 hours","B) 3 hours","C) 3.5 hours","D) 4 hours"],"correct":2,"hint":"Calculate the work done by A, then the remaining work, and finally the combined rate.","explanation":"Rate A=1/10, Rate B=1/15. A works 5 hours, completing 5*(1/10) = 1/2 task. Remaining task = 1/2. Combined rate = 1/10 + 1/15 = 5/30 = 1/6. Time = (1/2) / (1/6) = 3 hours."},{"id":3,"question":"A circular pizza with a radius of 10 inches is cut into 8 equal slices. What is the approximate area of one slice, in square inches? (Use π ≈ 3.14)","options":["A) 19.6","B) 31.4","C) 39.25","D) 78.5"],"correct":3,"hint":"First, calculate the total area of the pizza, then divide by the number of slices.","explanation":"Area of circle = πr^2 = π * (10)^2 = 100π. For 8 equal slices, area of one slice = (1/8) * 100π = 12.5π. Using π ≈ 3.14, Area = 12.5 * 3.14 = 39.25 square inches."},{"id":4,"question":"Train P leaves Station A at 9:00 AM traveling east at 60 mph. Train Q leaves Station A at 10:00 AM traveling east at 75 mph. At what time will Train Q overtake ","options":["A) 12:00 PM","B) 1:00 PM","C) 1:30 PM","D) 2:00 PM"],"correct":4,"hint":"Calculate the distance Train P travels before Train Q starts, then use relative speed.","explanation":"At 10:00 AM, P is 60 miles ahead (60 mph * 1 hr). Q starts. Relative speed = 75 - 60 = 15 mph. Time to overtake = 60 miles / 15 mph = 4 hours. Overtake time = 10:00 AM + 4 hours = 2:00 PM."},{"id":5,"question":"A class of 30 students has an average score of 75. If the average score of the 10 boys in the class is 70, what is the average score of the girls in the class?","options":["1) 77.5","2) 78","3) 78.5","4) 80"],"correct":1,"hint":"Calculate the total sum of scores for the entire class and for the boys first.","explanation":"Total class sum = 30 * 75 = 2250. Boys' total sum = 10 * 70 = 700. Girls count = 30 - 10 = 20. Girls' total sum = 2250 - 700 = 1550. Girls' average = 1550 / 20 = 77.5."}]},{"id":"verbal","title":"Verbal Reasoning","durationSec":2100,"items":[{"id":1,"question":"A company implemented a new flexible work schedule. In the following quarter, productivity decreased by 10%. The CEO concluded that flexible work schedules nega","options":["1) Many employees reported increased job satisfaction after the change.","2) During the same quarter, a major equipment failure caused significant downtime.","3) The company's main competitor experienced a similar productivity decline.","4) Employee turnover decreased substantially in the quarter after the change."],"correct":2,"hint":"Look for an alternative cause for the observed effect.","explanation":"The CEO attributes the productivity drop solely to the flexible work schedule. If a major equipment failure also occurred, it provides an alternative explanation for the productivity decrease, thus we"},{"id":2,"question":"To reduce operational costs, the city council plans to replace its fleet of gasoline-powered buses with electric buses. The council expects significant savings ","options":["A) The city has sufficient charging infrastructure for a large electric fleet.","B) The initial purchase cost of electric buses will be offset by long-term savings.","C) The cost of electricity will not increase substantially relative to gasoline prices.","D) Public demand for bus services will not decline over the next five years."],"correct":3,"hint":"Consider what must be true for the predicted savings to materialize regarding fuel costs.","explanation":"The city council expects savings from lower fuel (electricity) costs. If the cost of electricity rises significantly more than gasoline, the anticipated savings from 'lower fuel costs' might not mater"},{"id":3,"question":"The board decided to postpone the final decision until the next meeting due to the fact that there were several unresolved issues. Which of the following best r","options":["A) due to the fact that there were several unresolved issues","B) because several issues remained unresolved","C) on account of the fact that issues were unresolved","D) with several issues still being unresolved"],"correct":2,"hint":"Look for the most direct and concise way to express the causal relationship.","explanation":"The phrase 'due to the fact that there were' is unnecessarily wordy. 'Because several issues remained unresolved' conveys the same meaning much more concisely and directly, improving the sentence's cl"},{"id":4,"question":"A coffee shop owner observed that sales of their premium roast coffee increased by 15% after it was displayed prominently. The owner concluded that visible plac","options":["A) During the same period, overall coffee consumption in the city increased.","B) A competitor coffee shop saw no change in premium coffee sales despite a similar price.","C) When the shop returned the premium roast to its original shelf, sales declined to previous levels.","D) The owner also implemented a new marketing campaign for all coffee products."],"correct":3,"hint":"Look for evidence that directly links the action (visible placement) to the observed outcome (increased sales), or rules","explanation":"If sales of the premium roast coffee declined again after being moved back to the less visible shelf, it strongly suggests that the prominent display was indeed the cause of the sales increase, thus s"},{"id":5,"question":"To succeed in business, one must be innovative, persistent, and also have a strong sense of ethics. Which of the following best replaces 'and also have a strong","options":["A) and also have a strong sense of ethics","B) and possess a strong ethical sense","C) and ethically minded","D) and a strong sense of ethics as well"],"correct":3,"hint":"Ensure all items in a list follow the same grammatical structure.","explanation":"The original sentence lists three qualities: 'innovative' (adjective), 'persistent' (adjective), and 'have a strong sense of ethics' (verb phrase).
